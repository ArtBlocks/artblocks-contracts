/**
 * @title SRHooks
 * @author Art Blocks Inc.
 * @notice This hook verifies ownership of any custom squiggle PostParam setting,
 * and injects the squiggle's token hash into the token's PMPs if configured.
 * It supports delegate.xyz V1 and V2, and also allows squiggle #9998 for any address that
 * inscribed the squiggle Relic contract on eth mainnet.
 * It also allows resetting the squiggle token back to default #1981.
 * This hook contract has logic for both the augment and configure hooks.
 * It reverts if the squiggle token id doesn't pass relic or ownership checks during configuring.
 * Ownership checks are performed during configuring, keeping provenance history indexable and preventing
 * effects intuitive during transfers and delegation revocations.
 * If the squiggle token id is configured to be default #1981, the squiggle PostParams will
 * be stripped, allowing the owner to effectively "clear" the squiggle-related PostParams back to default.
 * @dev This contract follows the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern.
 * It uses OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts and must be deployed behind a proxy.
 * Only the owner can authorize upgrades via the _authorizeUpgrade function, which may 
 * be eventually disabled in future versions after to lock project functionality.
