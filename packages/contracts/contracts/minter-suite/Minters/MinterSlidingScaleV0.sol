/**
 * @title Shared, filtered Minter contract that allows tokens to be minted with
 * ETH at or above a configured minimum price ("pay what you want" with a floor).
 * This is designed to be used with GenArt721CoreContractV3 flagship or
 * engine contracts.
 * @author Art Blocks Inc.
 * @notice Privileged Roles and Ownership:
 * This contract is designed to be managed, with limited powers.
 * Privileged roles and abilities are controlled by the project's artist, which
 * can be modified by the core contract's Admin ACL contract. Both of these
 * roles hold extensive power and can modify minter details.
 * Care must be taken to ensure that the admin ACL contract and artist
 * addresses are secure behind a multi-sig or other access control mechanism.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted to a project's artist:
 * - updatePricePerTokenInWei (sets minimum price)
 * - syncProjectMaxInvocationsToCore
 * - manuallyLimitProjectMaxInvocations
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Additional admin and artist privileged roles may be described on other
 * contracts that this minter integrates with.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * @notice Caution: While Engine projects must be registered on the Art Blocks
 * Core Registry to assign this minter, this minter does not enforce that a
 * project is registered when configured or queried. This is primarily for gas
 * optimization purposes. It is, therefore, possible that fake projects may be
 * configured on this minter, but they will not be able to mint tokens due to
 * checks performed by this minter's Minter Filter.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * @notice Pricing Mechanism:
 * This minter accepts payments at or above a configured minimum price per token.
 * The full amount sent (msg.value) is accepted and split among stakeholders
 * according to the configured revenue splits - no refund is issued for amounts
 * above the minimum price.
